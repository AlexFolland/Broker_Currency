# Broker_Currency

A World of Warcraft AddOn that offers a LibDataBroker display of currencies and gold totals for session / today / yesterday / this week / last week. 

This basically exposes the currency tab for all characters on a realm. You can track, for example, Justice Points by enabling or disabling those in the broker display itself, or only in the tooltip when hovering over it.

Minimalists can turn off silver and gold display as well as disable the actual icon so you get just the gold amount showing. The icon sizes are adjustable as well.
